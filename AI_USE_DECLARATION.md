AI Use Declaration for rePawsitory Project
This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools (GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT) under the following conditions:

1. AI was used for:
   - Code suggestions and debugging assistance
   - Explaining programming concepts and best practices
   - Generating boilerplate code structures
   - Troubleshooting errors and implementation issues

2. All AI-generated code was reviewed, understood, and modified to fit the project requirements. No code was directly copied without understanding its purpose and functionality.

3. All AI suggestions were validated through:
   - Testing the code functionality
   - Researching the underlying concepts in documentation
   - Understanding how each component works within the system
   - Verifying the code meets project specifications

4. I can explain and demonstrate understanding of:
   - The complete architecture of the application (frontend and backend)
   - How authentication and authorization work using JWT
   - Database schema design and relationships between models
   - API endpoint implementation and data flow
   - React component structure and state management
   - Access control logic for pet owners and veterinarians
   - File upload functionality and storage

5. Key decisions made independently:
   - Database schema design for users, pets, medical records, and access control
   - User interface layout and user experience flow
   - Feature implementation approach (profile completion system, access granting)
   - API endpoint structure and data validation rules
   - Security measures and permission checks

All code in this submission has been reviewed, understood, tested, and validated to ensure it meets the project requirements and that I maintain full understanding of its implementation.
